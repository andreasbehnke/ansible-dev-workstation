# ansible-dev-workstation

This playbook

* will setup a complete development workstation for building
web applications based on javascript, java, postgres and using virtualization
tools like vagrant to run development server.

* is optimized for my personal requirements at work, feel free
to fork and make your own changes.

* is not very sophisticated, it is simple and straight forward.
